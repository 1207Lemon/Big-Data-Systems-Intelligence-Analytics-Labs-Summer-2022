Generating MetaData for image Dataset
This module consist for create_metadata function which extracts metadata of the image passed and returns it as a csv file
Author Parth Shah shah.parth3@northeastern.edu'
Created at 11th June 2022
Creating Metadata is means you need to make a for loop which iterates over all your images and pass all your images through Pillow package
which will extract the metadata such as image size, image color, image channels. Make use of this metadata for you expecations and profling.

    This Function downloads the csv file with metadata for image folder provided
    Parameters:
    ---------------------
    image_directory: string
        Directory of Images where they are all stored.
    extra_file: string
        File Path for the file which you want to merge with the Dataset for this example it is annotations file
